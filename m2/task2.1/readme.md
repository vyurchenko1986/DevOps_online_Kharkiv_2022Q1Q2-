# Module 2 Virtualization and Cloud Basic
TASK 2.1
## PART 1. HYPERVISORS
1. What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?

2. Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.

## PART 2. WORK WITH VIRTUALBOX
1. First run VirtualBox and Virtual Machine (VM).

1.1 Get acquainted with the structure of the user manual VirtualBox [1] (see list of references in the end of the document)

1.2 From the official VirtualBox site [2] download the latest stable version of VirtualBox according to the host operating system (OS) installed on the student's workplace. For Windows, the file may be called, for example, VirtualBox-6.1.10-138449-Win.exe. Install VirtualBox.

1.5 Get acquainted with the possibilities of VM1 control - start, stop, reboot, save state, use Host key and keyboard shortcuts, mouse capture, etc. [1, ch.1.9].

1.6 Clone an existing VM1 by creating a VM2 [1, ch.1.14].

1.7 Create a group of two VM: VM1, VM2 and learn the functions related to groups [1, ch.1.10].

1.8 For VM1, changing its state, take several different snapshots, forming a branched tree of snapshots [1, ch.1.11]

1.9 Export VM1. Save the *.ova file to disk. Import VM from *.ova file [1, ch.1.15].

2. Configuration of virtual machines

2.1 Explore VM configuration options (general settings, system settings, display, storage, audio, network, etc.).

2.2 Configure the USB to connect the USB ports of the host machine to the VM [1, ch.3.11].

2.3 Configure a shared folder to exchange data between the virtual machine and the host [1, ch.4.3].

2.4 Configure different network modes for VM1, VM2. Check the connection between VM1, VM2, Host, Internet for different network modes. You can use the ping command to do this. Make a table of possible connections.

3. Work with CLI through VBoxManage.

3.1 Run the cmd.exe command line.

3.2 Examine the purpose and execute the basic commands of VBoxManage list, showvminfo, createvm, startvm, modifyvm, clonevm, snapshot, controlvm [1, ch.8].

## PART 3. WORK WITH VAGRANT
1. Download the required version of Vagrant according to the instructions [5] and according to the host operating system (OS) installed on the student's workplace. For Windows, the file may be called, for example, vagrant_2.2.0_x86_64.msi. Install Vagrant. Check the path to Vagrant bin in the Path variable (My computer -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables).

2. Run the powershell. Create a folder "student name" (in English). In this example, create a folder vagrant_test. Next, go to the folder.

3. Initialize the environment with the default Vagrant box: init hashicorp/precise64

4. Run vagrant up and watch for messages during VM boot and startup.

5. Connect to the VM using the program MobaXterm or PuTTY (can be downloaded from [6]), using SSH, IP address and port listed above (127.0.0.1:2222). By default, login - vagrant and password are also vagrant

6. Record the date and time by executing the date command

7. Stop and delete the created VM.

8. Create your own Vagrant box [7] 

9. (optional) Create a test environment from a few servers. Servers' parameters are chosen independently by the student.
